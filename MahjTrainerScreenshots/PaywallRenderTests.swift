/// so a plain `simctl launch` can only ever show the paywall's empty state, and
/// The Debug-only bridge reads display values from the bundled `.storekit`
/// catalog and wraps StoreKit products so the shipping paywall view renders
/// unmodified without creating a RevenueCat customer.
///

///
/// Like `ScreenshotTests`, this never calls XCTFail on a missing element: a
/// failing UI test spends ten minutes collecting simulator diagnostics before
/// it tells you anything.
